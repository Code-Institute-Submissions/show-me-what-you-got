# Show Me What You Got
__[View the live project here]()__

__Show Me What You Got__ is a memory matching game using characters from [Rick and Morty tv series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/). Gamers can play solo against the countdown timer or against the computer, and keep track of their scores in order to know how well their memory skills improved. This mini webgame targets gamers using mobile/tablet but also can be played on desktop.

This is the second milestone project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). The main purpose of this project is to design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.

## Game Design
### Game Stories

A giant alien head suddenly appears and threatens to eliminate the Earth using giant lasers, from an interglatic talent competition, unless the Earth can show them what we got. While Rick and Morty are composing a new catchy song to save the world, __you__ will have to buy some time for them by playing a matching game.

### Game Play
There are __02 play modes__: play solo against the countdown timer (under the giant head's supervision, of course!), or play against the giant head itself.

At the beginning of the game, all the cards are mixed up and laid in row, face down on the table.

- __Play solo against the countdown timer:__
   - Player turns 1 card to start the game. This card stays open.
   - Player turns the 2nd card.
     - If these two cards are a pair, then they stay open, and player win points. These points can be automatically exchanged into extra time.
     - If these two cards are not a pair, then they both turn faced down again. 
   - Player keep doing like that until all the cards are open within the given time frame (and player wins!); or until time's up (and player loses!)
   - All the attemps will be recorded, so player will know how many attemps they had to try throughout the game.

- __Play against the giant head:__
   - Player turn 1 card to start the game. This card stays open.
   - Player turn the 2nd card.
      - If these two cards are a pair, then they stay open. It's a win for the player, and he/she can turn 2 more cards.
      - If these two cards are not a pair, then they both turn faced down, and it's the giant head's turn to play.
   - Player and the giant head take turns to keep doing like that, until all the cards are open. All the wins will be recorded, so at the end of the game, who has more wins will be the winner.
   - Who starts the game (player or the giant head) is random.

- There are __03 levels__: easy (8 cards), normal (12 cards), and hard (16 cards). At the end of each game, player can choose to stay at the same level or switch to different one.

### Unfixed Bugs

## Deployment
### GitHub Pages

The steps to deploy via GitHub Pages:

1. Log into Github account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository]().
3. Click the 'Settings' option at the top of the repository.
4. Click the 'Pages' option on the left-hand menu, located near the bottom.
5. Within the 'Source' tab Select the drop-down titled 'None'.
6. Select the branch named 'main' (in some cases it can be named 'Master').
7. Click 'Save'.
8. You will be prompted with a URL to your deployed site.
9. Site deployed.

When the above steps have been completed, it can sometimes take a moment for the deployed URL to update. It is enough to refresh the page until the site is fully deployed.

### Forking The GitHub Repository

To use this code and make changes without affecting the original code you can do what is called 'Forking the repository'. By forking this repository you are given a copy of the code at that moment in time that you can use freely. To fork this repository you need to follow the following few steps:

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository]() that you want to fork.
3. In the upper-right of the repository, click the 'Fork' button.
4. A copy of the Repository will now be available within your repositories.

You will now have a copy of the code available to clone and work on without affecting the original code.

### Cloning the Project

To make a local clone of the project follow these steps:

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository]().
3. In the upper section of the repository click the dropdown named 'Code'.
4. Copy the SHH address.
5. Open GitBash
6. Navigate to the correct directory.
7. Create a new directory named 'maias-orchard'.
8. CD into 'maias-orchard'.
9. Enter 'git clone SSH_ADDRESS'
10. GitBash will clone the repository into this directory.
11. Enter 'code .' and this will open VS CODE and happy coding.
